# Protocol

1. Grab 9 (or less depending on the number of wasps available) deli containers with holes
   in the side.
2. Fill each hole with cotton.
3. Fill each container with ~30 2nd and 3rd instar aphids (squish adults) plus 1–2 fava
   bean stems. Wasps will not attack adults, and their high reproduction may increase the
   mortality of the parasitized aphids.
4. Bring deli containers down to the lab. Never bring wasps into the greenhouse when
   doing these exposures.
5. Add 3–5 female wasps to each deli container using pooter inserted through hole in the
   side of deli container.
6. Leave aphids with the wasps for 12–14 hours.
7. Return wasps to the colony.
8. Put aphids onto potted fava beans covered with a plastic tube. Label the pot with
   "mummy" and the date. You can put 1–3 deli containers of aphids in each pot.
9. Put all mummy pots under a light set to be on for 16 hours per day, still in the lab.
10. In 8–9 days, mummies should form. Using forceps and/or scissors, place all mummies
   into petri dishes, making sure all mummies have enough room for wasps to emerge.
   Label petri dishes with the date and whether they go into the fridge (see note below).
11. Move petri dishes to a clean (i.e., wiped down and containing no wasps) rearing cage.


## Putting mummies in the fridge:
* For normal maintenance, place half the petri dishes in the fridge and keep the other half to maintain the colony.
* The reason to keep some mummies in the fridge is to have an additional stock of wasps in case something goes wrong in the colony.
* Ideally there should be wasps simultaneously in three stages: parasitized aphids, mummies in fridge, and adults in rearing cage.
* Do not keep mummies in the fridge for more than a month. After a month, place them in the wasp colony.
