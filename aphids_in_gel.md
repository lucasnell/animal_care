# Protocol for aphids in agar gel

> This protocol is for 8 petri dishes

* Grab fava bean plant(s), enough that you'll have 8 leaf pairs
* Turn the hot plate to 6
* Wipe down petri dishes with ethanol
* In a beaker, mix together 4g agar powder with 200 mL water
* Put the beaker on the hot plate and mix frequently
* While you're waiting for the agar to dissolve, set the petri dishes
  on their lids so that they're tilted a bit
* Once the agar is dissolved, split the solution among the 8 petri dishes.
* Wait for the agar to reach about 100F. Ideally you'll measure this using
  a temperature gun. If you don't have one, waiting ~2 minutes usually works.
  You want the gel to be as cool as possible while still being liquid.
* Once the proper temperature has been reached, stick the end of each leaf 
  pair into the gel.
* Wait for the gels to solidify completely. 
* Trim off excess leaf if they won't fit in the dish with the lid on.
* Add a piece of dry sponge. This will absorb excess moisture.
  Make sure it's short enough to fit in the dish when the lid is on.
* Add aphids and cover.
* Put petri dishes into the cooler / growth chamber.
