- `observer`: Your name
- `date`: Date you're doing the counts. Use the format mm/dd/YY (e.g., "01/31/2018").
- `Juv.`: Juvenile aphid counts on a given plant section
- `Adults`: Adult aphid counts on a given plant section

## Other notes:

- Make sure that plenty of water remains in the trays. This keeps aphids from moving
  between pots.
- Try not to do the counts too late in the day (like 7 or 8 pm). This is to avoid
  interrupting their light cycle.
- It's easier to count aphids on the cart that's in the growth chamber room than to try
  to do it with the pots still in the growth chamber.
