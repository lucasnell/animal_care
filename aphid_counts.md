# Aphid counts

## Protocol

1. Get a fava bean plant, and cut it down so it has only 3
  sets of leaves.
2. Push a plastic tube down into the soil, and grab a screen and 
  deli container (no need to put them on yet).
3. Place two adult aphids (non-winged) of the same line on the soil 
  inside the pot.
4. Cover the tube with the screen and deli container.
5. Count aphids every day.
6. You can end when the total number of aphids drops for three 
  consecutive days or when it falls below 80% of the maximum,
  whichever occurs first.


## Data sheets

### Top labels

- `Line`: Name of aphid line (e.g., "WI-L4")
- `Rep`: Repetition number for the focal aphid line

- `observer`: Your name
- `date`: Date you're doing the counts. Use the format mm/dd/YY (e.g., "01/31/2018").
- `Juv.`: Juvenile aphid counts on a given plant section
- `Adults`: Adult aphid counts on a given plant section

## Other notes:

- Make sure that plenty of water remains in the trays. This keeps aphids from moving
  between pots.
- Try not to do the counts too late in the day (like 7 or 8 pm). This is to avoid
  interrupting their light cycle.
- It's easier to count aphids on the cart that's in the growth chamber room than to try
  to do it with the pots still in the growth chamber.
- Using the small flashlight from the greenhouse to shine a light into the pots can be
  helpful for counting, especially for the green aphids.
