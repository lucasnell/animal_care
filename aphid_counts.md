# Aphid counts

## Protocol

1. Get a fava bean plant, and cut it down so it has only 3
  sets of leaves.
2. Push a plastic tube down into the soil, and grab a screen and
  deli container (no need to put them on yet).
3. Label the pot with the aphid line you'll be putting in there, plus the
  repetition number for that line.
3. Place two adult aphids (non-winged) of the same line on the soil
  inside the pot.
4. Cover the tube with the screen and deli container.
5. Put the pot inside a screen "sock" and tie the top.
6. Count aphids every day.
6. You can end when the total number of aphids drops for three
  consecutive days or when it falls below 80% of the maximum,
  whichever occurs first.


## Data sheets

### Top labels

- `Line`: Name of aphid line (e.g., "WI-L4")
- `Rep`: Repetition number for the focal aphid line
- `Year`: Year in which you're starting the assay
- `Month`: Month in which you're starting the assay

### Column names

- `day`: Day of the month you're doing the counts. If you pass into another month,
  you can simply write the new day; it'll be obvious what happened.
- `observer`: Your name
- `W`: Watered plant. Check this box on the day you watered this plant.
- `D`: Dying plant. Check this box if the plant is dying on that day.
- `J`: Juvenile aphid counts on a given plant section
- `A`: Adult aphid counts on a given plant section
- `notes`: In here, write in numbers of aphids that are on the ground or on the wall
  of the tube. Write them like this:
  `40A, 60J ground; 20A wall` for 40 adults and 60 juveniles on the ground,
  and 20 adults on the wall.

## Other notes:

- __Water plants once per week (or more if they seem to be wilting).__
  Water the plants slowly along the sides of the pot without taking off the tube.
  This is to minimize the number of aphids you're drowning.
  Do it after counts to avoid knocking more aphids off the plants.
- __Be cafeful to shake the pots as little as possible.__
  This can increase aphid mortality, plus we're trying to get estimates of dispersal.
- Try not to do the counts too late in the day (like 7 or 8 pm). This is to avoid
  interrupting their light cycle.
- It's easier to count aphids on the cart that's in the growth chamber room than to try
  to do it with the pots still in the growth chamber.
- Using the small flashlight on your cell phone to shine a light into the pots can be
  helpful for counting, especially for the green aphids.
