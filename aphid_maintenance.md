# Maintaining aphid lines

Updated 4 Dec 2018

## Temporary note:

We're now keeping all clonal lines on alfalfa and clover.
These are present in room 504B.


## Keeping aphids around

- Keep 3 pots of each aphid line alive at all times.
- Stagger the inoculation of plants with a given aphid line to prevent
  them all dying out at once.
  Extra plants for a given line aren't super useful if they die on the same day.




## Reducing fungus gnats:

> Although the adults are harmless, fungus gnat larvae can harm plant roots.

For more info, see <http://ipm.ucanr.edu/PMG/PESTNOTES/pn7448.html>

- Allow pots to dry completely before watering again. Gnat larvae like wet soil.
- Reduce the movement of adults from pots. We can do this by keeping all pots covered
  until all adult gnats are dead, and by keeping the compost covered as well.
- Add bacteria that kill gnat larvae to the soil.
  You want *Bacillus thuringiensis* subspecies *israelensis* (Bti), the kind marketed
  to control mosquitoes. Note that Bt for caterpillar control won't work.
- Add nematodes (*Steinernema feltiae*) to the soil.



## Avoiding aphid contamination:

- __Socks\:__ Always wrap aphid tubes with a mesh sock that's tied at the top.
  The mesh socks are located in the greenhouse.
  (The only exception to this rule is if you have the pots inside the mesh cages.)
- __Opening cages\:__ Never open an aphid tube/sock inside the plant- or aphid-growing
  sections of the greenhouse. Only open them inside the entry room, with sliding
  doors closed.
- __Inspection\:__ Before adding aphids to a fresh plant, inspect the new plant to
  make sure that there are no aphids on it.
  Green aphids are hard to find on green plants, so look carefully.
- __Isolation\:__ Only work with one clone at a time. 
  Never have cages to multiple clones open at once.
  Clean the work area and wash your hands/arms between different clones.
  Check your clothing for stray aphids. They're surprisingly good at clinging to things!
- __Doors\:__ Keep the sliding doors to 504A and 504B closed to avoid clone
  contamination. We want to keep as many barriers to aphids moving around as possible
  as often as possible.
- __Labels\:__ Label pots with aphid clone names and other info when necessary
  (e.g., date when aphids were added, name of experiment, ...)
- __Trays - water\:__ Keep water in the bottoms of trays containing caged pots of aphids.
  Check water levels of these "moats" a few times per week.
- __Trays - isolation\:__ Put different clones in separate trays.
  Order them red – green – red – green on the bench or in the growth chamber so that
  you are more likely to discover if contamination has occurred.
- __Bridges\:__  Don't leave the excess mesh hanging down around the top of one cage
  touching another cage of a different clone.
  Basically, avoid anything that aphids could use as a bridge between pots.
- __Tubes - inspection\:__ Inspect mylar cages before each use to make sure there
  are no gaps at the seam or where the mesh window is attached to the mylar.
- __Tubes - bottoms\:__ Sink mylar tubes firmly into soil so that aphids can't
  crawl under. Add more soil as needed so that cages are securely in place with no gaps.
- __Tubes - lids\:__ Check that lids of cages (mesh held in place by plastic collar)
  fit well, and that there are no gaps where aphids could escape.
  Use a large enough mesh piece!
- If you need to keep aphids from moving around, use "insect-a-slip" ("Fluon").
  (Tanglefoot does NOT reliably work on aphids.)

## Getting Potting Soil

- "ProMix HP" from Walnut Street Greenhouse (525 Walnut St)
- Write on the chalkboard: # bags taken, Ives Lab (Integrative Biology), other
  information as instructed.
- Contact: Isaac Kabera <isaac.kabera@wisc.edu>


## Seeds

- Store all seeds in a labelled box in the 4th floor lab, not in the greenhouse.
- Why: The greenhouse can get very hot (>90 F), especially at transitions between
  seasons when the air cooling system isn't working effectively.
  Excessive heat can kill seeds, so it's better to store them in the lab room downstairs.


## Trays

- The standard "1020" trays are 11" wide x 21.37" long x 2.44" deep.
- Trays with holes in the bottom: allow draining so plants don't get overwatered.
  Use these for pots of plants without aphids (i.e., when growing up new plants
  from seed).
- Trays without holes in the bottom: you can fill these with water to make a "moat"
  around pots of plants with aphids.
  The hope is that aphids that escape from a caged plant will fall into the water
  and die before they're able to contaminate another plant.


## Composting old/dead plants

- Keep the lids on the compost bins (large black garbage cans) at all times.
  This serves two functions:
  (1\) to prevent aphids present on composted plants from escaping and
  (2\) to reduce fungus gnats' ability to get in or out.
- If a plant has lots of live aphids on it:  keep caged and netted pot in the
  greenhouse entrance room until aphids are dead. Then compost it.
- Only open the compost bins when the sliding doors to the greenhouse rooms are closed.
- Aphid-free, mold-free, and root-free soil can be saved in the blue Tupperware bin
  for re-use.  
- Rinse the mylar cages and pots before next use (because there might be aphids on them).
  If there were never wasps in the pot (and thus no risk of mummies being present),
  you can also potentially store them in the entrance room for a few days before
  putting them back into the greenhouse.
- Remove all labels from trays, pots, and plastic collar lids!


## Wasps

- Never have wasps in the greenhouse. That is all.

## Greenhouse lights with timers

- Exposure to adequate light (15 hours light: 9 hours dark) is important to keep
  pea aphids reproducing clonally.
- It can take a few minutes for the metal halide bulbs to warm up.
  If bulbs flicker on and off once warmed up, then they need to be replaced.


## Growth chamber

- Standard conditions for maintaining pea aphid clones:
  15 hours light ("44" light setting), 9 hours dark ("00" light setting), 20ºC.
