Output from HOBO loggers put into the 5th floor greenhouse and B1 growing room 
in Birge.

`greenhouse_south_raw.txt` contains an extra column that's unnecessary.

Files names coincide with locations:

* `greenhouse_experiment.txt`: 5th floor greenhouse, right room.
* `greenhouse_plants.txt`: 5th floor greenhouse, left room, middle rack where we're 
  currently growing plants.
* `greenhouse_south.txt`: 5th floor greenhouse, left room, back rack in the little "nook"
  near the door to a storage closet (not one for the Ives lab).
* `growing_room.txt`: B1 growing room, inner room "F", after setting thermostat to 
  68ºF (~ 20ºC).
